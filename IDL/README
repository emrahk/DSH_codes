This directory holds all confirmed IDL programs for the DSH analysis.

OBTAINING PROFILES FROM IMAGES:

getprofile.pro : This program reads a Chandra fluxed image and plots the radial
profile of the scattering halo around a source and calculates the surface brightness profile

elimpointsrc.pro : This program removes circular regions centered on detected    point sources in images and calculates new areas in each annulus. Called by getprofile.pro

wrappers for different chips:

1. wrap_fluxed_rgb_chip7_mrad5_FLAT.pro : get profiles from fluxed blank sky images
2. wrap_fluxed_rgb_chip6_mrad5_FLAT.pro
3. wrap_fluxed_rgb_chip67_mrad5_FLAT.pro : combine profiles and subtract blanksky backgrounds.

SBP MODELING

1. sim_prof.pro : This program is written to simulate SBP for given dust parameters. The resolution is 10 pc. Divides the cloud into 10 pc regions so thin cloud criteria is satisfied.

wrappers for near and far distances for Chandra, these use reid distances and also include a simple chi2 routine.

wrap_simprof_cont_MC80_mde2reid.pro
wrap_simprof_cont_MC80nd_mde2reid.pro

How to run these wrappers:

 restore,'DATA/resparex_reid_use1.sav' ; cloud parameters
 restore,'DATA/parcloud_fit'
 wrap_simprof_cont_MC80_mde2reid,resparex_reid, cloudpar=parcloud_reid, outsbp=sbpout_fit, syserr=0.04,/ps,fname='sbpfit.eps'

Files you need:

resparexXX.sav : a structure containing information about clouds obtained through fitting the CO spectrum with gaussians
parcloud_XX.sav : input/output of results. Note that if you use a variable that has not been loaded, it will fill it with default values
glcbin24.0h_regbg_hv0.csv : MAXI light curve in csv form.
prof_rgbc67mrad5_deflare_FLAT.sav : profile obtained by image analysis (see above)

copied into DATA directory

For swift
 wrap_simprof_cont_swift06fl2_mdreid.pro: for the T14 swift observation. Others are similar, just keeping this in  github
